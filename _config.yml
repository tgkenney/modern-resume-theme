  Hello, my name is Tyler Kenney and I am currently a Management Information Systems student at West Virginia University.
  This major has a focus on connecting the business world with programming by using the .NET Core and C# to
  explore web development.  There is a large focus on clear communication with business leaders and users to complete projects.
  Computers have always been my passion and I'm interested in basically every aspect of this field, from troubleshooting hardware,
  to the new realm of cloud computing.  I've even earned a Certified Solutions Architect certification from AWS recently.  I've spent
  a lot of my time learning various technologies that business use everyday including Active Directory, VMWare, Veeam, and Group Policy.

  At home, I like to tinker with my homelab.  My lab consists of a old server repurposed with VMWare's ESXi.  This allows me to
  run different virtual machines on top to mess with whatever projects I like.  I currently use it to self host things like a 
  local NAS, a financial planner, a RSS reader, an asset tracker, and even this website is hosted on it!.

    I am currently completing my BSBA in Management Information Systems at WVU. 
    Management Information Systems is a major that merges together the business 
    and computer world, acting as a link between the two that can allow businesses
    to function more efficiently. The major teaches us how to communicate to 
    business leaders effectively, while also focusing on technical proficiency in 
    programming languages such as C# and Python.

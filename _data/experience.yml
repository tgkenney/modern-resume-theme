    I am currently working as a summer intern with WVU Medicine's IT department.  I work with the Midrange team providing support
    for storage clusters and Unix systems forming the backbone of the hospital's records management system.  Some of the projects 
    I have completed with this team include monitoring and comparing performance of new hardware, integrating RHEL systems into
    WVUHS' AD environment for central authentication, and building scripts to allow users access to a set of tools to ease the
    workload on members of the team.

    While working as an Application Support and Network Operations
    Intern at the WVU Foundation I assisted with the administration of
    the server and network infrastructure. I also covered the Response
    Center which is responsible for responding to and troubleshooting
    user issues. I used tools such as Windows Active Directory,
    OneLogin, Lansweeper, and Splunk to ensure smooth operation of
    user computer systems.
